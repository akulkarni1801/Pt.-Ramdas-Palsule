            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <hr class="hr2">
            <p>Ramdas was born in well-educated family in Pune. His father Dr. G. B. Palsule was a recipient of the
                prestigious President’s Award, Kalidas Puraskar, K.K. Birla Award and many more for his work in Sanskrit
                literature and for his Sanskrit epic – ‘Vainaayakam’ on Swaatantryaveer Savarkar.

                Ramdas is an alumnus of prestigious alma-maters like Jnana Prabodhini Prashala and College of
                Engineering, Pune (COEP). He was introduced to Tabla by Pt. G. L. Samant in his school days. After
                achieving his Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering, he chose his passion over an assured career
                in engineering at the age of twenty-three. He became a disciple of Tabla Maestro Taalyogi Pt. Suresh
                Talwalkar. With his natural ingenuity, relentless toil, he made strides as an acclaimed soloist and a
                versatile accompanist.</p>

                the praise of connoisseurs and patriarchs alike with his refreshingly vivid style of presentation and
                with his trademark subtle contemporary touch. Ramdas is aptly known in the music fraternity as a riyaazi

                Khansaheb in February 2018. He has enthralled audiences with his enchanting solo performances as well as
