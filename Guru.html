                <p>Ramdas is a founder member and a Guru at Avartan Gurukul - a unique institution for studying
                    Hindustani
                    music in Pune, India. His rich educational background helps him understand the nuances of the
                    pedagogical aspects of Hindustani music. Ramdas is ably carrying forward his Guru Pandit Suresh
                    Talwalkar ji's legacy by imparting knowledge to music students through the Guru-Shishya tradition,
                    without any remuneration, for which his Guru feels proud of him. Students from all over India and
                    abroad
                    have been learning from him, many of whom have made their mark in the field of Classical Music as
                    performers. Saleel Tambe (UK), Harshad Kanetkar (USA), Nikhil Harishchandrakar (Australia), Ganesh
                    Tanawade, Einav Baram (Israel), Pablo Llambias (Chile) and many more of his students are spread
                    across
                    the globe.

                    Ramdas strongly believes that art and art education must be ingrained with Sanskaar, and not merely
                    be
                    transfer of information. He insists on nourishing and nurturing students not only as capable
                    musicians,
                    but also as cultured and responsible citizens. This only underlines his dedication and devotion
                    towards
                    the cause of Indian Classical Music and his genuine urge to make a difference to the society at
                    large.
                    He is also teaching Tabla to a few differently-abled students for several years and is an
                    inspiration
                    for his students and other gurus alike.</p>
